# WalkLog

A lightweight web app for tracking kennel cage care. Each cage has Inner and Outer cells (or combined) that can be marked as Not yet, Walked, or Do not walk. Add optional notes per cage. Built with React and Supabase for persistent storage. Designed for quick marking and real-time updates.
